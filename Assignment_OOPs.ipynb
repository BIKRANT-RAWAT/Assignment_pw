        "1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "- OOP is a programming paradigm centered around objects that represent data as attribute and code as behavior. It helps in organizing complex programs using classes, inheritance, and modular design.\n",
        "---\n",
        "2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "- A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines attributes i.e. variables and methods i.e. functions that its objects will have.\n",
        "---\n",
        "3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "- An object is an instance of a class with actual values. It represents a real world entity and can access class attributes and methods.\n",
        "---\n",
        "4. What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "- Abstraction hides implementation details and shows only essential features of the class whereas, Encapsulation hides data by restricting direct access, typically using private variables given by (__).\n",
        "---\n",
        "5. What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "- Dunder also known as double underscore methods are special methods like __init__, __str__ etc. They enable operator overloading and built-in behavior customization.\n",
        "---\n",
        "6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.\n",
        "- Inheritance is a process where a new class (subclass or derived class) inherits properties and behaviors from an existing class (superclass or base class). This promotes code reusability and establishes a hierarchical class structures.\n",
        "---\n",
        "7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "- Polymorphism is a mechanism that allow different classes to implement methods with the same name differently. It enables functions or methods to process objects differently based on their class.\n",
        "---\n",
        "8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "- Encapsulation in Python is achieved through conventions rather than strict access modifiers. Private attributes are indicated by prefixing them with a single underscore (_private_attribute) or double underscores (__private_attribute) for name mangling. It protects internal object state and restricts unintended access.\n",
        "---\n",
        "9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "- The __init__ method acts as a constructor in python. It is a special method called automatically when a new object of a class is created, used to initialize the object's attributes.\n",
        "---\n",
        "10.  What are class and static methods in Python?\n",
        "- Class methods>> class methods are bound to the class and receive the class itself as the first argument i.e. 'cls'. They are defined using the @classmethod decorator and can modify class state.\n",
        "Static methods>> static methods are not bound to either the class or the instance. They don't receive self or cls as their first argument. They are defined using the @staticmethod decorator and are essentially regular functions logically grouped within a class.\n",
        "---\n",
        "11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "- Python does not support traditional method overloading where we can use multiple methods with the same name but different parameters exist within a single class. Instead, we can achieve similar functionality using default arguments, variable-length arguments (*args, **kwargs), or by checking argument types within a single method.\n",
        "---\n",
        "12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "- Method overriding is a feature where a subclass provides a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its superclass. This allows the subclass to change the behavior of the inherited method.\n",
        "---\n",
        "13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "- The @property decorator in Python is used to define getter, setter, and deleter methods for an attribute, allowing user to control how an attribute is accessed, modified, or deleted while still interacting with it like a regular attribute.\n",
        "---\n",
        "14. Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "- Polymorphism enhances code flexibility, extensibility, and reusability. It ease writing generic code that can work with objects of different types, making the system more adaptable to changes and new functionalities.\n",
        "---\n",
        "15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "- An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated directly and has to be subclassed. It can contain abstract methods (methods without implementation) that must be implemented by its concrete subclasses. The abc module is used to create abstract classes.\n",
        "---\n",
        "16. What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "- The advantage of OOPs are:\n",
        "  \n",
        "   Modularity: Code is organized into self-contained objects.\n",
        "   \n",
        "   Reusability: Code can be reused through inheritance.\n",
        "   \n",
        "   Maintainability: Easier to debug and update code.\n",
        "   \n",
        "   Flexibility: Adaptable to changes and new features.\n",
        "   \n",
        "   Data Security: Encapsulation helps protect data.\n",
        "---\n",
        "17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable?\n",
        "- Class variables are shared by all instances of a class. They are defined within the class but outside any methods whereas, Instance variables are unique to each instance of a class. They are defined within methods (mostly __init__) using self.variable_name.\n",
        "---\n",
        "18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "- Multiple inheritance is a feature where a class can inherit from multiple parent classes, combining their attributes and methods. Python supports multiple inheritance, but it can lead to complexities like the \"diamond problem\".\n",
        "---\n",
        "19. Explain the purpose of __str__ and __repr__ methods in Python.\n",
        "- \"__str__ \" method provides a human-readable string representation of an object, primarily for end-users. e.g., when using print(), While, \"__repr__\" provides an \"official\" or unambiguous string representation of an object, primarily for developers, often aiming to be a valid Python expression that could recreate an object.\n",
        "---\n",
        "20. What is the significance of the super() function in Python?\n",
        "- The super() function in Python is used to call methods and access attributes of a parent or sibling class in a multiple inheritance hierarchy. It's commonly used in a subclass \"__init__\" method to call the parent class \"__init__\" and ensure proper initialization.\n",
        "---\n",
        "21. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",
        "- The \"__del__\" method, also known as the destructor, is called when an object is about to be garbage collected i.e., when its reference count drops to zero. It is used for cleanup operations, like releasing external resources.\n",
        "---\n",
        "22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        "- \"@staticmethod\" decorated methods do not receive self (instance) or cls (class) as their first argument. They behave like regular functions but are logically grouped within the class whereas, \"@classmethod\" decorated methods receive the class (cls) as their first argument, allowing them to access and modify class-level attributes or create new instances of the class.\n",
        "---\n",
        "23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "- Polymorphism with inheritance in Python is primarily achieved through method overriding. A subclass can redefine a method inherited from its superclass, and when that method is called on an object, the appropriate version i.e. from the subclass or superclass, is executed based on the object's actual type.\n",
        "---\n",
        "24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "- Method chaining is a technique where multiple method calls are strung together on a single object, with each method returning the object itself, allowing the next method to be called on the same object. This can lead to more concise and precise code.\n",
        "---\n",
        "25. What is the purpose of the __call__ method in Python?\n",
        "- The \"__call__\" method allows an object to be called like a function. If a class defines this method, instances of that class can be invoked using parentheses, making them \"callable objects.\"\n",
