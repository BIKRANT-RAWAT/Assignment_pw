        "\n",
        "15. How does Python's garbage collection system work?\n",
        "- Python primarily uses reference counting, where each object keeps track of the number of references pointing to it. When the reference count drops to zero, the object is deallocated. Moreover, it also uses a generational garbage collector to handle circular references and collect objects that are not reachable through reference counting.\n",

        "16. What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling?\n",

        "19. What is the importance of closing a file in Python?\n",
